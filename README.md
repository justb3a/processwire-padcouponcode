## Usage

Just install the module, no configuration is needed.  

The module adds a template called `pad_couponcode` and appends it as product template (**PadCart** module settings).
It creates the following fields and adds them to the template: `pad_couponcode`, `pad_limit`, `pad_valid_from`, `pad_valid_until` and `pad_price`.
Furthermore it adds the `pad_couponcode` field to the `padorder` template in the last position. If you want to change the position, open `padorder` template and drag it onto the desired position.

## Add a coupon code

Create a new page, assign template `pad_couponcode` and fill out all the appropriate fields. 

- **title** – will be displayed as title in the shopping cart
- **coupon code** – this field is prefilled with a generated coupon code, of course, it is also possible to manually change it to something else
- **one-time use** – activate the checkbox if the coupon code may be used only once
- **price** – the value must be preceded by a minus (-) sign
- **valid from** – the date from which the card is valid
- **valid until** – the date up to which the card is valid

## Notes

1. Only one coupon code can be redeemed per order.
2. If one-time use is enabled, the coupon code will be disabled after usage.
